CODE 1:


n=5;
for(i=0;i<n;i++){
	//----STARING OF FOR LOOP
	printf("%d",i);
	//-----ENDING OF FOR LOOP
}

step1: i is initialized to 1 (i=1)
step2: checks if i<n.if True enter inside the for block.if False comes out of for loop.
	 Here i=0 so, as 0<5 is true so enter inside the for block
step3: prints value at i
	 Here i is 0 as prints 0 in output screen-----0
step4: As we are at end of for block, now incrementing the value of i by 1 takes palce
	 So i=i+1
	 i.e., i=1
step5: checks if i<n.if True enter inside the for block.if False comes out of for loop.
	 Here i=1 so, as 1<5 is true so enter inside the for block
step6: prints value at i
	 Here i is 1 as prints 1 in output screen------1
step7:  As we are at end of for block, now incrementing the value of i by 1 takes palce
	 So i=i+1
	 i.e., i=2
step8: checks if i<n.if True enter inside the for block.if False comes out of for loop.
	 Here i=2 so, as 2<5 is true so enter inside the for block
step9: prints value at i
	 Here i is 2 as prints 2 in output screen-----2
step10: As we are at end of for block, now incrementing the value of i by 1 takes palce
	 So i=i+1
	 i.e., i=3
step11: checks if i<n.if True enter inside the for block.if False comes out of for loop.
	 Here i=3 so, as 3<5 is true so enter inside the for block
step12: prints value at i
	 Here i is 3 as prints 3 in output screen-----3
step13: As we are at end of for block, now incrementing the value of i by 1 takes palce
	 So i=i+1
	 i.e., i=4
step14: checks if i<n.if True enter inside the for block.if False comes out of for loop.
	 Here i=4 so, as 4<5 is true so enter inside the for block
step15: prints value at i
	 Here i is 4 as prints 4 in output screen---4
step16: As we are at end of for block, now incrementing the value of i by 1 takes palce
	 So i=i+1
	 i.e., i=5
step17: checks if i<n.if True enter inside the for block.if False comes out of for loop.
	 Here i=5 so, as 5<5 is False so control comes out of the loop
step18: End

the abode code 1 is written on python as shoen below:

for i in range(5):
	print(i)



CODE 2:

for(i=0;i<3;i++){	//----OUTER FOR LOOP
	//----INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP
	for(j=0;j<2;j++){	//------INNER FOR LOOP
		//----INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP
		printf("%d",i+j);
		//----END OF INNER FOR LOOP
	}
	//----OUTSIDE THE INNER FOR LOOP
	//----END OF OUTER FOR LOOP
}
//----OUTSIDE THE OUTER FOR LOOP

step1: i=0
step2: checks the condition of OUTER FOR LOOP i.e.,i<3.If true entres INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP. If false then comes OUTSIDE THE OUTER FOR LOOP
	 here i=0. so, as 0<3 is true enters INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP
step3: Here, in INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP, we have the inner for loop
	 so,j=0
step4: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=0. So, as 0<2 is True,so enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP
step5: Here in INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP we print value of i+j
	 as i=0,j=0 i+j=0 so print 0 -----print 0
step6: As,we are at END OF INNER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of j by 1
	 i.e., j=j+1 so, j=1
step7: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=1. So, as 1<2 is True,so enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP
step8: Here in INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP we print value of i+j
	 as i=0,j=1 i+j=1 so print 1 -----print 1
step9: As,we are at END OF INNER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of j by 1
	 i.e., j=j+1 so, j=2
step10: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=2. So, as 2<2 is False,so it comes OUTSIDE THE INNER FOR LOOP
step11: As,we are at END OF OUTER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of i by 1
	 i.e., i=i+1 so, i=1
step12: checks the condition of OUTER FOR LOOP i.e.,i<3.If true entres INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP. If false then comes OUTSIDE THE OUTER FOR LOOP
	 here i=1. so, as 1<3 is true enters INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP
step13: Here, in INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP, we have the inner for loop
	 so,j=0
step14: Here in INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP we print value of i+j
	 as i=1,j=0 i+j=1 so print 1 -----print 1
step15: As,we are at END OF INNER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of j by 1
	 i.e., j=j+1 so, j=1
step16: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=1. So, as 1<2 is True,so enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP
step17: Here in INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP we print value of i+j
	 as i=1,j=1 i+j=2 so print 2 -----print 2
step18: As,we are at END OF INNER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of j by 1
	 i.e., j=j+1 so, j=2
step19: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=2. So, as 2<2 is False,so it comes OUTSIDE THE INNER FOR LOOP
step20:  As,we are at END OF OUTER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of i by 1
	 i.e., i=i+1 so, i=2
step21: checks the condition of OUTER FOR LOOP i.e.,i<3.If true entres INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP. If false then comes OUTSIDE THE OUTER FOR LOOP
	 here i=2. so, as 2<3 is true enters INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP
step22: Here, in INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP, we have the inner for loop
	 so,j=0
step23: Here in INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP we print value of i+j
	 as i=2,j=0 i+j=2 so print 2 -----print 2
step24: As,we are at END OF INNER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of j by 1
	 i.e., j=j+1 so, j=1
step25: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=1. So, as 1<2 is True,so enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP
step26: Here in INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP we print value of i+j
	 as i=2,j=1 i+j=3 so print 3 -----print 3
step27:  As,we are at END OF INNER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of j by 1
	 i.e., j=j+1 so, j=2
step28: checks the condition of INNER FOR LOOP i.e.,j<2. IF true then enters INSIDE INNER FOR LOOP.IF false then comes out of INNER FOR LOOP
	 here j=2. So, as 2<2 is False,so it comes OUTSIDE THE INNER FOR LOOP
step29: As,we are at END OF OUTER FOR LOOP, we increment the value of i by 1
	 i.e., i=i+1 so, i=3
step 30: checks the condition of OUTER FOR LOOP i.e.,i<3.If true entres INSIDE OUTER FOR LOOP. If false then comes OUTSIDE THE OUTER FOR LOOP
	 here i=3. so, as 3<3 is False it comes OUTSIDE THE OUTER FOR LOOP
step31: END
